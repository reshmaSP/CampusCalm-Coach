## Introduction:
Welcome to our comprehensive web application tailored for the diverse needs of 11th and 12th-grade students. This project integrates state-of-the-art technologies to address mental health, career guidance, and community engagement. Leveraging deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for emotion detection and incorporating psychological assessment tools like SRQ20, PHQ9, and GAD7, our platform tracks mental health indicators with precision.

Beyond mental health monitoring, machine learning classifiers correlate aptitude test results with career options and preferences obtained through surveys, providing personalized career guidance. The integration of OpenAI's Language Model (LLM) powers a personalized chatbot for tailored mental health guidance, ensuring a supportive and personalized experience for each user.

Our application also fosters a vibrant community for mental health awareness through blog sharing, promoting an environment of empathy and support among students. With this amalgamation of cutting-edge technology and empathetic support mechanisms, our aim is to empower students in their educational journey by providing holistic support for mental health, career guidance, and community engagement.
